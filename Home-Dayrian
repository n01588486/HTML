        <h3>Highlighted Restaurants</h3>
        <p>
            The highlighted restaurant is a restaurant that has uniqueness to itself and continues to push itself into the food
            scene either as an up-and-coming or a seasoned restaurant that deserves to be featured. We hope to allow less informed
            people of the multitude of food scenes that they can hopefully get to experience and decide for themselves if it is
            getting the recognition it deserves.

                <td>McDonald's is undoubtedly a standout in the fast-food culinary landscape, and we firmly believe it deserves recognition and
                    celebration for its extensive menu offerings and unwavering consistency. While McDonald's is a household name, it remains a
                    pioneer in the industry by continually introducing innovative menu items. Its wide range of choices caters to diverse tastes,
                    making it an ideal choice for virtually anyone. Given these factors, we are proud to showcase McDonald's as a highlighted
                    establishment in the world of fast food.

                    perfect for those seeking a more substantial meal. This renowned establishment reliably delivers satisfaction and never leaves
                    patrons hungry. Thanks to Wendy's ability to consistently provide hearty and fulfilling options, we have chosen to feature it

                <td>Pizza Hut stands out as a pizzeria that remains committed to the concept of family dining, diverging from the typical fast-food
                    approach. It steadfastly maintains its unique identity, setting itself apart from other similar establishments. Pizza Hut is the
                    natural choice for families seeking a dining experience that combines the pleasures of restaurant dining with the delectable taste
                    of pizza and a diverse range of accompanying dishes. For these compelling reasons, we highly recommend Pizza Hut, not only for its
                    delicious food but also for the enjoyable restaurant atmosphere it provides.
